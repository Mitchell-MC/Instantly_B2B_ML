## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Categorization Logic

```python
# Multi-source industry categorization
1. Primary: organization_industry keyword matching
2. Secondary: organization_data JSON extraction
3. Tertiary: company_domain analysis
4. Fallback: "Other" category

# Multi-source seniority categorization
1. Primary: seniority column mapping
2. Secondary: title column keyword analysis
3. Fallback: "Other" category
```
